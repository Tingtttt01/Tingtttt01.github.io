<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

**Welcome!**

I'm Yiting, and you can call me Viva.

I am going to graduate from Zhejiang University with a Master's Degree in Journalism and Communication in June 2025. Resovled to become a communication reseacher, I am currently preparing for my PhD application.

My research interest lies in **social support, interpersonal and technology-mediated communication, especially at the intersection of family and health contexts**. I am greatly fascinated by an ultimate question: **How can we support each other to overcome challenges in this constantly changing world?**

Out of my academic zone, I go hiking, climb mountains and ride a bike on a regular basis to reinvigorate myself. 

If you are interested in talking with me, please feel free to email me at 22323065@zju.edu.cn
