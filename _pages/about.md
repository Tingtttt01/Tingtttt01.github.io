**Welcome!**

I'm Yiting, and you can pronunce my name as "E-ting Lyo".

Receiving my Master's degree in Journalism and Communication from Zhejiang University in June 2025, I am currently pursuing a Ph.D in communication at Rutgers University.

My research interest lies in **social support, interpersonal and technology-mediated communication, especially at the intersection of family and health contexts**. I am greatly fascinated by an ultimate question: **How can we support each other to overcome challenges in this constantly changing world?**

Out of my academic zone, I go hiking, climb mountains and ride a bike on a regular basis to reinvigorate myself. 

If you are interested in talking with me, please feel free to email me at yiting.liu01@rutgers.edu
